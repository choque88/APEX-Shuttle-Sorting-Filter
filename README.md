 # APEX-Shuttle-Sorting-Filter

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choque88/APEX-Shuttle-Sorting-Filter/main/example.gif)

This plug-in allows to always keep shuttles sorted and add a filter to them.

You can decide if you want sorting and filtering, only sorting or only filtering.

If you activate sorting, with or without the filter, you can decide if you want ascending or descending sorting.
